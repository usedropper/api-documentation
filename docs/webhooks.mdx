# Webhooks

:::tip
Webhooks allow you to set up a notification system that can be used to receive updates on certain requests made to the Dropper API.
We recommend that you use webhooks to provide value to your customers over using callbacks or polling.

### Webhooks vs Polling

> Polling is when your application periodically calls an API to check if an event has occurred or new data exists. 
> Webhooks, on the other, send data down to your application when an event occurs **in real-time**. 
> To capture the difference between these two approaches with a relatable example, polling is like going to the post office to check if you have new mail. 
> Using webhooks is like having mail delivered to your house every time you have new mail simply by giving the postman your house address. 
> Polling is **more resource-heavy** compared to webhooks, as it can take multiple network requests before new information is discovered, 
> while webhooks only make network requests when there is new information. <sub><sup><a href="https://medium.com/hookdeck/webhooks-explained-what-are-webhooks-and-how-do-they-work-90c613c055a4">Read more...</a></sup></sub>

With webhooks, a resource server, Dropper in this case, sends updates to your server when the status of your request changes. 
A change in status of a request is known as an **event**. 
You'll typically listen to these events on a `POST` endpoint called your **webhook URL**.

<br/>

### Create a webhook URL
A webhook URL is simply a `POST` endpoint that a resource server sends updates to.
After creating your webhook, you can set your webhook URL on the [Dropper dashboard](https://dashboard.usedropper.com).

When your webhook URL receives an event, it needs to parse and acknowledge the event. 
Acknowledging an event means returning a `200 OK` in the HTTP header. 
Without a `200 OK` in the response header, we'll send **2 retries 3 minutes apart**.

```jsx title="Create a webhook"
// Using express
app.post("/your/webhook/url", function(req, res) {
    const event = req.body;
    // Process event  
    
    res.send(200);
});
```

:::caution
If you have a long-running task in your webhook, you should acknowledge the event before 
executing the task to prevent a request timeout and an automatic error response from your server.
Without a timely `200 OK` response, we retry the event as described above.

### Verify event origin
Since your webhook URL is publicly available, you need to verify that events originate from Dropper and not a bad actor.
You can do this by signature validation.


```jsx title="Webhook signature validation"
const crypto = require('crypto');
const secret = process.env.DROPPER_API_KEY;

// Using express
app.post("/your/webhook/url", function(req, res) {
    // Validate event
    const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha512', secret).update(JSON.stringify(req.body)).digest('hex');
    if (hash == req.headers['x-dropper-signature']) {
        const event = req.body;
        // Process event  
    }
    res.send(200);
});
```

<br/>

### Supported webhook events

:::info
It is possible to receive **multiple events** at once through your webhook so the `events` field is an array of **event codes**.
For example, a weight change can trigger a price update. 
In this scenario, we will process the weight change and update your wallet balance accordingly. 
Thus, the data sent to your webhook will look like:
```json
{
  "events": [
    "balance.update",
    "delivery.weight.update"
  ],
  "data": {
    ...
  }
}
```

### Webhook checklist

Now that we've covered all there is to know about using webhooks with Dropper's API, here is a recap to ensure you have a great experience:

+ Add the webhook URL on your [Dropper dashboard](https://dashboard.usedropper.com).
+ Ensure your webhook URL is publicly available (localhost URLs cannot receive events).
+ Test your webhook to ensure you're getting the JSON body and returning a `200 OK` HTTP response.
+ If your webhook function has long-running tasks, you should first acknowledge receiving the webhook by returning a `200 OK` before proceeding with the tasks.
+ If we don't get a `200 OK` HTTP response from your webhooks, we flagged it as a failed attempt and retry twice 3 minutes apart.
